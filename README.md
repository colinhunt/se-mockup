# [Haywire for Elm Style-Elements](https://colinhunt.github.io/se-mockup/)
(working title)

Create UI wireframes for elm apps using the excellent 
[mdgriffith/style-element](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/mdgriffith/style-elements/4.3.0/) library.
See your layouts rendered in real-time exactly as they would appear in your app.

This is because Haywire renders the layout using the actual elements and attributes you pick in your design.
The goal is to decrease cycle time figuring out the combination of elements you need to get a the layout you expect,
elminating the compile/reload overhead.
