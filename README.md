# [Haywire](https://colinhunt.github.io/se-mockup/) for Elm Style-Elements
*(working title)*

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/colinhunt/se-mockup.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/colinhunt/se-mockup)

Create UI wireframes for elm apps using elements from the excellent 
[mdgriffith/style-elements](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/mdgriffith/style-elements/4.3.0/) library.
See your layouts rendered in real-time exactly as they would appear in your app.

This is because Haywire renders the layout using the actual elements and attributes you pick in your design.
The goal is to decrease the cycle time in figuring out the combination of elements you need to get the layout you expect,
by elminating the compile/reload overhead.

## Disclaimer
This is in early-alpha stage and likely contains many ~bugs~surprises.
Your work may be lost or corrupted at any time. 
Save/load is currently not implemented but is impending!

More documentation to come.
